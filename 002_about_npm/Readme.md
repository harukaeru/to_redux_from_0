You can use JavaScript libraries.

For this, initialize `package.json`, the manager of JavaScript libraries.

`--yes` is optional. If you don't use this, you are just asked how it creates by terminal.
```javascript
$ npm init --yes
```

You can see how it is. However you don't need to know why it is, yet.
```sh
$ cat package.json
```
